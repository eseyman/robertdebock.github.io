# [Infrastructure as code](#infrastructure-as-code)

I use a couple of tools to automate my day-to-day work.

- [Ansible roles](ansible.md) - [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) roles that are [simple in style](style.html) and [work well](how-to-use-these-roles.html) together on many distributions and many Ansible version.
- [Terraform modules](terraform.md) - [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io) modules to deploy infrastructure of whole solutions.
- [Docker images](docker.md) - [Docker](https://www.docker.com) is mostly used to contain some functionality to test or deploy software.
- [GitHub actions](github-actions.md) - [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) are used to make CI more consumable.
- [Other tools](others.md) - To make my life a little easier.

See errors? Please help and [make a merge request on git](https://github.com/robertdebock/robertdebock.github.io/).
